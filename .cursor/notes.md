# Future Things to Add
 
 - export feature to get all entries for an employee in txt file. export would show the employee name at the top, position, and list out all entries in chronological order (earliest at the top to most recent at the bottom) with the rating given, the tags assigned, and the date it was written and modified.  past edits would not show
 - filter ability on employee's page to search text and filter by tags; filter by which user wrote an entry
 - create an org so users can share employees, positions, and tags; 1 user is the admin to control the employees, positions, and tags
