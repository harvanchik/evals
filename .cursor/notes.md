# Future Things to Add

- A way to add tags to a review entry. Default tags would be TEAMCR Values.
- A way to filter employees on the home page. Filters: Most Recently evaluated, least recently evaluated, not yet evaluated, highest ratings avg (desc), lowest ratings avg (asc), most evaluations (desc), least evaluations (asc)
- A way to edit past evaluations. Evals will save the creation date and date last modified. And you'd be able to see past iterations of the evaluation through an expanded menu


- rename the app to EPT short for Employee Performance Tracker (will be pronounced "epty")
